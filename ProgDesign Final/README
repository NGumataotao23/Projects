Final for Program Design and Data Structures
Uses a mixture of a linked list and SDL2 to create a mp3 player that can 
add and delete songs, MP3's placed in the music folder can be played 
To add songs you must include ".mp3" at the end
to remove songs from the queue you must add "music/" before the songs name plus the ".mp3"(to be fixed in future)
SDL2 and SDL2_mixer are NOT MINE:
